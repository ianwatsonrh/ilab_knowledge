# Pig Latin

Pig Latin is a language game, argot, or cant in which words in English are altered, usually by adding a fabricated suffix or by moving the onset or initial consonant or consonant cluster of a word to the end of the word and adding a vocalic syllable (usually -ay or /eÉª/) to create such a suffix.[1] For example, Wikipedia would become Ikipediaway (taking the 'W' and 'ay' to create a suffix). The objective is often to conceal the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer; Pig Latin is simply a form of argot or jargon unrelated to Latin, and the name is used for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language. It is most often used by young children as a fun way to confuse people unfamiliar with Pig Latin.

## Rules

For words that begin with consonant sounds, the initial consonant is moved to the end of the word, then "ay" is added, as in the following examples

"pig" = "igpay"
"latin" = "atinlay"
"banana" = "ananabay"
When words begin with consonant clusters (multiple consonants that form one sound), the whole sound is moved to the end (before adding "ay") when speaking or writing.

"friends" = "iendsfray"
"smile" = "ilesmay"
"string" = "ingstray"
For words that begin with vowel sounds, one just adds "hay", "way", "nay" or "yay" to the end. Examples are:

"eat" = "eatway"
"omelet" = "omeletway"
"are" = "areway"
An alternative convention for words beginning with vowel sounds, one moves the initial vowel(s) along with the first consonant or consonant cluster. This usually only works for words with more than one syllable and offers a more unique variant of the words in keeping with the mysterious, unrecognizable sounds of the converted words. Examples are:

"every" = "eryevay"
"omelet" = "eletomay"
"another" = "otheranay"
Sentence structure remains the same as it would in English. Pronunciation of some words may be a little difficult for beginners, but people can easily understand Pig Latin with practice.

# Usage

Pig Latin is mainly used for fun. It can also be used by children or young adults to hide conversation. For example, a conversation between two people in the presence of an unwanted other may consist of: "ehay isway eryvay illysay" = "he is very silly".
